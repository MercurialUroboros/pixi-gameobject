# pixi-gameobject
This project tries to solve how to build a pixi.js game without an old fashioned MVC pattern.
The aim is creating reusable components like the modern front-end frameworks are doing nowadays.
The structure of a pixi-gameobject component is greatly inspired from single file components in VueJs.

More docs WIP.
